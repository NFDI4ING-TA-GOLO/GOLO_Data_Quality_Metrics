Defintion

F1. Identifier
=========

(Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier 

Both data and metadata (information describing the data) are given an identification code that is globally unique
and remains constant over time. This identifier is unique on a global scale, ensuring that no other data or metadata
share the same identifier. Additionally, the identifier remains persistent, meaning it doesn't change over time or
under different circumstances, providing a stable reference point for locating and accessing the specific data or metadata.
This practice is crucial for effective data management, sharing, and tracking, as it enables unambiguous and long-term identification
of the associated information.

Example: Digital Object Identifier (DOI) 

F2. Rich Metadata
=========

Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)

Metadata provides extensive information about the data, going beyond basic or minimal descriptors.
Rich metadata typically includes details such as the origin
of the data, the methodology used to collect it, the format, relevant dates, and other contextual
information that enhances understanding and usability.

F3. Reference to identifier
=========

Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes.

In other words, within the metadata, there is a direct and unmistakable 
indication of the identifier associated with the corresponding dataset.Having the identifier explicitly
mentioned in the metadata helps establish a direct connection between the descriptive information (metadata) and the actual data it describes,
facilitating proper identification, retrieval, and management of the data.

F4. Searchable Results
=========

(meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
