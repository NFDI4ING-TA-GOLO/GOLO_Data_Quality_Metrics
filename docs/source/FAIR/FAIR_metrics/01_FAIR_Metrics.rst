   * - FIELD, 
     - DESCRIPTION
   * - Metric Identifier
     - FAIR Metrics should, themselves, be FAIR objects, 
     and thus should have globally unique identifiers.   
   * - Metric Name
     - A human-readable name for the metric
   * - To which principle does it apply? 
     - Metrics should address only one subprinciple, since
      each FAIR principle is particular to one feature of a digital
      resource; metrics that address multiple principles are likely
      to be measuring multiple features, and those should be separated
      whenever possible.
   * - What is being measured? 
     - A precise description of the aspect of that digital
     resource that is going to be evaluated
   * - Why should we measure it?
     - Describe why it is relevant to measure this aspect
   * - What must be provided?
     - What information is required to make this measurement?
   * - How do we measure it?
     - In what way will that information be evaluated?
   * - What is a valid result?
     - What outcome represents "success" versus "failure"
   * - For which digital resource(s) isthis relevant?
     - If possible, a metric should apply to all digital resources;
     however, some metrics may be applicable only to a subset. In this case,
     it is necessary to specify the range of resources to which the metric is
     reasonably applicable.
   * - Examples of their application across types of digital resource
     - Whenever possible, provide an existing example of success, and an example of failure.
