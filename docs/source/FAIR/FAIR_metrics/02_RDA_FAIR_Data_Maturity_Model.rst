RDA FAIR Data Maturity Model
********************

In response to the diversity of FAIRness measurements arising from various interpretations of the principles,
the RDA Working Group "FAIR data maturity model," formed in January 2019, seeks to create a unified set of fundamental
assessment criteria for FAIRness, intended to be adopted as an RDA Recommendation. Throughout 2019 and the initial months of 2020,
the working group formulated a series of indicators and corresponding maturity levels.

As a result of the work, a first set of guidelines and a checklist related to the implementation of the
indicators were produced, with the objective to further align the guidelines for evaluating FAIRness
with the needs of the community. [3]

RDA ranks priority for each item (“● useful / ●● important / ●●● essential”) and provides suggestion for assessment (implementation).

Currently there are 41 indicators.
