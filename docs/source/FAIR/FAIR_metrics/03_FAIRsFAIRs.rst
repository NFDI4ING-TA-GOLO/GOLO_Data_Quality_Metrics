Version 0.5 of this specification introduces 17 minimum viable metrics designed to systematically gauge the FAIRness
of research data objects. A research data object, encompassing data, metadata, and documentation (such as policies and procedures),
plays a crucial role in shaping the FAIR assessment implementation. These components can either serve as resources for evaluation or 
act as evidence supporting FAIR implementation. The metrics are developed incrementally and are rooted in indicators proposed by the
RDA FAIR Data Maturity Model Working Group, as well as previous contributions from project partners like FAIRdat and FAIREnough, and 
the WDS/RDA Assessment of Data Fitness for Use checklist. Continuous refinement of the metrics has been achieved through processes such
as focus groups, internal reviews, public feedback, and the utilization of tools like F-UJI and FAIR-Aware, specifically designed
to assist FAIR assessment in selected use cases. The automated FAIR assessment tool (F-UJI) has been applied to datasets
from five CoreTrustSeal certified repositories. We encourage the adaptation of these metrics and tools
to support various FAIR assessment scenarios throughout the research data lifecycle.

The metrics adhere to the format outlined in the template (Table 2), which has been adjusted from Wilkinson et al. [1].
In each metric table, we furnish descriptions and assessment particulars,
along with the metric's correlation to the pertinent FAIR principle(s) and CoreTrustSeal requirement(s). Currently there are 17 items.
