FAIR Metric for EOSC
********************

The EOSC FAIR Working Group (WG) has been assigned the responsibility of defining a collection of metrics for
evaluating the FAIRness of datasets and other digital objects to be utilized within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).
To carry out this task, the FAIR WG established a Metrics and Certification Task Force, working in tandem with related certification initiatives.
