A1. Common protocol
=========

(Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol

The data or metadata can be accessed or retrieved based on a specific identifier assigned to them.
Each piece of data or metadata has a unique identifier that allows for precise retrieval.

The retrieval process follows a standardized set of rules or conventions for communication. This typically involves
a well-defined protocol, which is a set of rules or guidelines that facilitate the exchange of information between systems. 
Standardization ensures consistency and interoperability, allowing different systems to communicate seamlessly.

A1.1. open, free, universal
--------------------

The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

This means, protocol is one that is transparent, cost-free, and accessible
to a wide range of users, fostering widespread adoption
and collaboration in the implementation of the communication standards it defines.

A1.2. Authentication and authorization
--------------------

the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary

Authentication: This is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device,
or system. Authentication ensures that the entity trying to access a resource is who it claims to be. Common methods
of authentication include passwords, digital certificates, or other credentials.

Authorization: Once an entity is authenticated, authorization determines what actions or resources that
entity is allowed to access. It involves granting specific permissions or rights based on the authenticated 
identity. Authorization mechanisms control what a user or system can do within a given system or application.

For example: Dataverse provides public machine-accessible interfaces to
search the data, access the metadata and download the data files, using a token to grant access when
data files are restricted.

A2. Metadata remain
=========

Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.

This practice ensures that users can still gain insights into the characteristics, context, and other details of the data,
even if the data itself is no longer accessible due to reasons such as deletion, relocation, or unavailability.

In essence, separating metadata accessibility from data availability allows users to understand the
context and content of the data, even if the data files are no longer present or accessible. This approach supports transparency, documentation, and the potential for reusing
or understanding the context of research or datasets, even if the data is no longer directly accessible.
