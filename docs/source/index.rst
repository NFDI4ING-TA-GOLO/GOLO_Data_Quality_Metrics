Welcome to our comprehensive resource hub dedicated to quality metrics in various domains. This wiki serves as a guide to understanding, evaluating, and applying metrics across diverse fields, including:

**FAIR Metrics**: Detailed insights into Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability principles.
General Quality Metrics: Essential concepts like Completeness, Accuracy, Consistency, and Timeliness.
Image Quality Metrics: Evaluation methods such as Mean Squared Error and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio.
Pointcloud Quality Metrics: Standards and examples for assessing 3D data quality.
Machine Learning Metrics:

    Classification Metrics: Metrics like Accuracy, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix for evaluating model performance.
    Regression Metrics: Techniques for assessing predictive models.

Explore detailed explanations, hands-on examples, and code snippets that will empower you to work effectively with these metrics.

If you would like to make a scientific contribution to this site, feel free to clone the repository and create your own branch with a metric that is relevant to you.
